                                    <p align="left">University is the highest seat of learning. A university student is to learn socio-interaction, etiquette, exercise tolerance towards the opinions of the others and as a whole promote the intellectual ability beyond the domain of his/her main study.
                                    Apart from the rigorous CSE subjects, extracurricular activities like Cultural programs and Debate will broaden studentsâ€™ minds and enhance their worth appreciating qualities that will ultimately express the excellence of the CSE Department in particular and the UAP in general.
                                    With a pragmatic view to encouraging extracurricular activities, creating and sustaining a congenial environment for such activities, the CSE Department of the UAP has formed the CSE Cultural & Debating Club.
