# Uapians.Net

## Introduction
This project was developed as part of an assignment during my university time back in 2013. The Uapians.Net is a web-based application designed to facilitate student-teacher cooperation. It allows students to know each other better, communicate about academic aspects, and collaborate effectively. This project won the championship of the Inter-Department Project Show in 2013 and was live until 2016 under the University of Asia Pacific Software Club as a student project.

## Features

- **Blood Bank:** Information on students' blood groups along with their phone numbers and willingness to donate blood.
- **User Authentication:** Users need to log in to access certain features, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Notes Sharing:** Students can share their academic notes and documents.
